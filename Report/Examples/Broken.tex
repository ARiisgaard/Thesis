Thing are going to be broken in here


\section{Broken figure}


\begin{figure} [H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{Pictures/Example.jpg}	
	\caption{This is a picture}
	\label{Snake}
\end{figure}

This is a reference to figure \ref{Snake}. And this part of exercise is not 100\% fair, since I haven't described that particular type of error, but see if you can figure it out, by comparing to the other figures.
